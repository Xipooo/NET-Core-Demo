# NET-Core-Demo Walk Through

## How to start
Create an empty folder on your hard drive then;
Do one of the following:
1. Clone this repository to the empty folder and checkout the Step-1 branch.
2. Create a new project in the empty folder using the command: `dotnet new webapi`


## How to use this repository

Each branch is labeled acording to the order in which you make the changes on your project.  So Step-1 is the creation of your project using the command `dotnet new webapi` inside of a folder called WozUCoreDemo. Step-2 adds a HomeController class to the project and defines a couple of methods. And so on...

Each new branch step has comments included at the changes to indicate what the change is for.

You can use the GitHub comparison tool to view the differences between branches and see the changes from step to step.
